I WAS WEARING ONLY SHORTS AND A LONG SLEEVED T SHIRT. I HAD MY MIURA ROCK SHOES ON MY FEET, AND MY CHALK BAG DANGLING AT MY BACK, BUT NO HARNESS, AND NOT EVEN A SINGLE CARABINER. IN ONE POCKET I PUT A FEW CLIF KID ZBARS, MY FAVORITE MULTI PITCH SNACK, AND I FILLED A COLLAPSIBLE FLASK WITH ABOUT A THIRD OF A LITER OF WATER. I PUT THAT IN MY OTHER POCKET, THOUGH IT PULLED MY SHORTS DOWN A LITTLE. BUT I KNEW IT WOULD TAKE ME A FEW HOURS TO CLIMB THE ROUTE, AND I DID NOT WANT TO BE PARCHED BY THE TIME I REACHED THE HARD PITCHES UP HIGH. A PACK WAS OUT OF THE QUESTION, PARTLY BECAUSE OF ALL THE CHIMNEYS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROUTE, BUT MAINLY BECAUSE THE CLIMBING WAS HARD ENOUGH THAT I DID NOT WANT ANY EXTRA WEIGHT ON MY BODY.
