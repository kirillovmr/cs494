I started from creating single supplementary functions for caesar, salt, leet etc, and then created a function that would try all possible combinations of password permutations along with all possible hashing functions. Of course, that was bad approach and estimated time to finish was 3 days.
Then I optimized all functions to a be single list comprehension, realized that I have to make salt separately from all others and also don't hash with all available hash functions, but with that, result of which has the same length as the user hashed password. That's how I come up with the final solution.
